# Obsidian ‚Äî MetaCopy

The purpose of this plugin is to get quickly the value of a frontmatter key. You can set multiple value in settings, as : `key1, key2, key3, ...`

If the plugin found multiple key in the frontmatter : 
1. The context take the **first** value from the frontmatter. 
2. The command create a menu where you can choose the value you want. 

The value is added in your pasteboard, so you can paste it everywhere. 

Yeah. That's it.

## Create link from frontmatter
You can create a link using a frontmatter key. 
1. The key must be both in `key` and in `key link`
2. You need to configure the `base link` (note : don't forget the last `/` !)

The link creation work as the main plugin : Context menu will take the first value, so if this value is the link key, it will create a link.

The plugin is inspired by [Copy Publish URL](https://github.com/kometenstaub/copy-publish-url) but for all link (instead of only publish).

Also, the plugin is recommended to be used with [Obsidian To Mkdocs](https://github.com/Mara-Li/mkdocs_obsidian_publish) to copy link without editing the source file.
