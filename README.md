# Obsidian ‚Äî MetaCopy

The purpose of this plugin is to get quickly the value of a front matter key. You can set multiple value in settings, as : `key1, key2, key3, ...`

If the plugin found multiple key in the front matter :

1. The context takes the **first** value from the front matter.
2. The command creates a menu where you can choose the value you want.

The value is added in your pasteboard, so you can paste it everywhere.

Yeah. That's it.

Here is the plugin in action :

## Create link from front matter

You can create a link using a front matter key.

1. The key must be both in `key` and in `key link`
2. You need to configure the `base link` (note : don't forget the last `/` !)

The link creation work as the main plugin : file menu will take the first value, so if this value is the link key, it will create a link.

Also, the editor menu will add an option to copy the link if it exists.

## Disable menu

You can disable the menu using a front matter key. There are two
comportments :

1. Setting is enabled :
   The key must be present **and** set to **true** to **enable** the menu.
2. Setting is disabled:
   The default comportment.
   The key must be absent **or** set to **false** to **disable** the menu.

Regardless of the option, the command modal continue to work.

The plugin is inspired by [Copy Publish URL](https://github.com/kometenstaub/copy-publish-url) but for all link (instead of only publish).

Also, the plugin is recommended to be used with [Obsidian To Mkdocs](https://github.com/Mara-Li/mkdocs_obsidian_publish) to copy link without editing the source file.
